# Android CMD-ANE for Adobe AIR apps

If you ever wished you could have access to Android CMD API from your AIR application, this is the ANE you were looking for.

* [See the ANE setup requirements](https://github.com/myflashlab/CMD-ANE/blob/master/src/ANE/extension.xml)

**IMPORTANT:** Implementing ANEs in your AIR projects means you may be required to add some [dependencies](https://github.com/myflashlab/common-dependencies-ANE) or copy some frameworks or editing your app's manifest file. Our ANE setup instruction is designed in a human-readable format but you may still need to familiarize yourself with this format. [Read this post for more information](https://www.myflashlabs.com/understanding-ane-setup-instruction/)

If you think manually setting up ANEs in your projects is confusing or time-consuming, you better check the [ANELAB Software](https://github.com/myflashlab/ANE-LAB/).

# AIR Usage #

CMD.execute("/system/bin/ps", false, function ($output:String):void {
	trace($output);
});

// call the md5sum command on a file
CMD.execute("md5sum " + File.applicationDirectory.resolvePath("img.png").nativePath, false, function ($output:String):void {
	trace($output);
});
```
